# BJJ roadmap project 

The idea is to search for material online and create a compilation of techniques that a whitebelt shoud know well in BJJ. \
The idea is the white belt can learn a bit of these techniques and positions in a specific order, in a short amount of time, so the game starts to make sense earlier.\
Also relevant is the have the clear how the in fight progression is for the white belt. From this position, where should I go? What is my goal? \
 These questions should be easy to answer.
