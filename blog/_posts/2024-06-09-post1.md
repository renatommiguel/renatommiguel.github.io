# First post
I have been wanting to learn more about web technologies, and to write a blog.

I thought about hosting a website in Vercel, using one of their templates. That would have worked.

I could have just kept writing on a html on my github site as well.

One thing that I wanted for sure was to write any blog post, or whatever I would write in MD.

And that is what I am doing. This is being handled by Jenkyll. I am not really sure how that works yet, but I will figure it out.
