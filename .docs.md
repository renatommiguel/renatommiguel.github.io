### Asked phind to teach me html5 and css
#### Step 1: Understanding HTML5 Basics
HTML5 introduced new elements and attributes that make it easier to structure your web pages semantically. Start by learning the basics such as:

Doctype Declaration: <!DOCTYPE html> at the beginning of your document tells the browser that the page should be rendered using HTML5 standards.
Basic Structure: Every HTML5 document starts with a <html> tag, which contains a <head> section for metadata and a <body> section for the main content.
Semantic Elements: Learn about semantic tags like `<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>, <aside>,  <main>` to structure your content meaningfully.
Example of a simple HTML5 document:


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First HTML5 Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This is some text about me.</p>
        </article>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 2: Learning CSS Basics
CSS allows you to control the appearance of your HTML content. Start with the basics:

Selectors: Choose what element(s) you want to style. Examples include type selectors (p, div), class selectors (.myClass), and ID selectors (#myID).
Properties and Values: Apply styles by specifying properties and values. For example, color: blue; changes the text color to blue.
Box Model: Understand how elements are laid out using the box model, which consists of content, padding, border, and margin.
Example of a simple CSS file:
````css
/* This will apply to all <p> elements */
p {
    color: blue;
}

/* This applies to elements with the class 'highlight' */
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}

/* This applies to the element with the ID 'special' */
#special {
    font-size: 20px;
}````
